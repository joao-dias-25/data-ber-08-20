## Project Description
    

I chose to built a simple encrypt and decrypt a message with a key. 
A part of the code will generate and store a key in a file.
The second part i encrypt your message and store it in a file trough a key that you selected. 
the third part is the decrypt method of the message trough a key


I chose this project thi project to understand how basic encryption work. I could go deeper but i didnt manage to find time, so i build other features around it.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
    
first - how to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt the message
second - use this key to encrypt a message and store in a file
third to access the encryption you will have to login with a password
the message is store in a file.
to decrypt the message simple use the decrypt_msg() function 
 


## Organization

I did a drawing.
 


What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

there is a jupyter notebook file
some key files already generated that stores the key and you can call it afterwards
some .txt files created to store the encrypted message
