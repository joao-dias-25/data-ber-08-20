# Project: Business Intelligence with Tableau

## Overview

The goal of this project is undestand the type of UFO sightings and if there any relation between dates and shapes on diferent locations.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* You must construct a Tableau Story consisting of at least 5 story points for the data set you have chosen.
* You must use Story features such as captions and annotations.
* You must demonstrate all the concepts we covered in the chapter (sorting, filtering, different visualizations types, aggregations, etc.).
* Your Tableau workbook consisting of at least 5 visualizations and 1 Story should be saved to Tableau Public.
* You should create a Github repo for this project, and your data should be saved to that repo in a folder named data.
* You should also include a README.md file that describes the steps you took, your thought process as you built your visualizations and Story in Tableau, and a link to your workbook on Tableau Public.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this chapter.

* **A Tableau workbook uploaded to Tableau Public** that contains the visualizations and Story you created from your data set.
* **An data folder** containing the data set you used for your project.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of your approach and code for constructing visualizations and organizing them into a Story as well as your results, obstacles encountered, lessons learned, and a link to your completed Tableau workbook.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Find a data set to process** - a great place to start looking would be [Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) and [Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
* **Explore the data set** and come up with a variety of visualizations that you can potentially include in your story.
* **Break the project down into different steps** - identify the entities/dimensions in your data set, explore them each individually, and then progress to analyzing different combinations of them.
* **Use the tools in your tool kit** - the concepts and methods you have learned in the business intelligence chapter as well as some of the things you've learned in previous chapters. This is a great way to start tying everything you've learned together!
* **Work through the lessons in class** & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your project each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often**, donâ€™t be afraid of doing something incorrectly because you can always roll back to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.
